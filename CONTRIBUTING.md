## Coding Style

This project uses ESLint and Prettier. To ensure your code meets our style guidelines:

2. Run `npm run lint` to check your code for errors.

## Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for writing commit messages:
- Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Start with a capital letter.
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
